#Mcbase

This is Mcbase v2, because too many changes we want to make would have an adverse effect on older sites running on v1. 

Some planned changes include: 

- moving primary layout into the starter theme and away from the base
- moving responsive js into starter theme and away from base
- moving main menu out of the template and into the blocks, where other modules can do things to it
- switching to border-box model for main layout rows and columns
- simplify templates
- and etc

Mcbase is a base theme mashup for Drupal grounded on Boron for the HTML 5 goodness, with 

- some Tao for styling resets
- normalise CSS 
- theming tools from Clean
- more theming stuff from Zen
